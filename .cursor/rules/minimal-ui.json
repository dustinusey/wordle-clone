    "Use the `primary` and `secondary` theme colors via Tailwind for consistency.",
    "Letter states in the game should each have a unique color class defined and used via Tailwind utility classes.",
    "UI components like buttons, inputs, dropdowns, and accordions should be created as customizable and reusable components.",
    "Use Framer Motion to animate components where appropriate (e.g., page transitions, modal entrances, hover effects).",
    "Use Lucide icons via `react-icons` when icons are required.",
    "Always consider that the user may have edited AI-generated code, so avoid overwriting custom modifications.",
    "Avoid TypeScript, use JavaScript and JSX only."
